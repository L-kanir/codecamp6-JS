      User experience (UX) is a person's emotions and attitudes about using a
      particular product, system or service. It includes the practical,
      experiential, affective, meaningful and valuable aspects of human–computer
      interaction and product ownership. Additionally, it includes a person's
      perceptions of system aspects such as utility, ease of use and efficiency.
      User experience may be subjective in nature to the degree that it is about
      individual perception and thought with respect to a product or system.
      User experience varies dynamically, constantly modifying over time due to
      changing usage circumstances. Simplified, user experience is about how a
      user interacts with, and experiences, a product.

      User interface design (UI) or user interface engineering is the design of
      user interfaces for machines and software, such as computers, home
      appliances, mobile devices, and other electronic devices, with the focus
      on maximizing usability and the user experience. The goal of user
      interface design is to make the user's interaction as simple and efficient
      as possible, in terms of accomplishing user goals (user-centered design).
      Good user interface design facilitates finishing the task at hand without
      drawing unnecessary attention to itself. Graphic design and typography are
      utilized to support its usability, influencing how the user performs
      certain interactions and improving the aesthetic appeal of the design;
      design aesthetics may enhance or detract from the ability of users to use
      the functions of the interface.[1] The design process must balance
      technical functionality and visual elements (e.g., mental model) to create
      a system that is not only operational but also usable and adaptable to
      changing user needs. Interface design is involved in a wide range of
      projects, from computer systems, to cars, to commercial planes; all of
      these projects involve much of the same basic human interactions yet also
      require some unique skills and knowledge. As a result, designers tend to
      specialize in certain types of projects and have skills centered on their
      expertise, whether it is a software design, user research, web design, or
      industrial design.

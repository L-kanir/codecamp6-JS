          "Simplicity requires a two-step process. First, we must invest time
          and energy to discover what stirs us as human beings, what makes our
          hearts sing, and what brings us joy. Then, we must proceed to create
          the life that reflects the unique people we truly are. This is the
          heart and soul of simplicity."
